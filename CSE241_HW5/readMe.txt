functions.h is a namespace class. All the test driver in there. But we have to 
create a new game at the beginning. I also wrote global function that takes a parameter 
as a AbstarctHex but I did not implement it.
We have a playgame function in all the classes except AbstractHex class. Game has been played
in playgame function. PlayGame function is different in HexVector. It uses iterator to checking all the 
indexes.
